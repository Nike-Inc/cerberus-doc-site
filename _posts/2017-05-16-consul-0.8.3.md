Puppet module for Consul has been updated to the latest version 0.8.3 (from 0.7.5).

**WARNING!!! if you are currently running Conul 0.6.4, please upgrade all nodes to 0.7.5 before going to version 0.8.3.**

Upgrade directions:

1. Verify you are currently running Consul 0.7.5 on all nodes, e.g. use `consul members` command
2. Run `update-consul-config` with CLI version 1.4.0 or newer to make the config changes needed for Consul 0.8.x or newer.
3. Bake new AMIs for both Vault and Consul.
4. Upgrade Consul using the  `update-stack` command
5. Upgrade Vault nodes using the  `update-stack` command (Vault nodes run Consul clients)

In our testing, this upgrade went smoothly without downtime but downgrading Consul back to 0.7.5 did not work.

Do not use Consul 0.8.0 because it will not work with CloudFormation.
